# COVID-Prediction-Model

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the process of predicting whether a person has COVID-19 based on a given dataset. The notebook includes three main sections:

1. **Initial Data Processing and Modeling**: Building a model without using a column transformer.
2. **Enhanced Data Processing with Column Transformer and Pipeline**: Simplifying the workflow using a column transformer and pipeline.
3. **Model Building Using Linear Regression**: Developing a linear regression model to predict COVID-19 presence.

The project showcases the progression from basic data handling to more sophisticated machine learning techniques, providing a comprehensive approach to model building and prediction.

## Contents

- `LinearRegressionModel.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and model building.
